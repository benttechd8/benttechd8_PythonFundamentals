#You got this!
#Practice!
#Bottom in seat, fingers on keys!


# operators:
# test your addition might, add 12 and 8:
12 + 8
# now store the sum in a variable called sum:
sum = 12 + 8

# test subtraction of 10 - 5:
10 - 5
# now store the remander in a variable called rem:
rem = 10 - 5

# test your multiplication, multiple sum * rem:
sum * rem
# store the above in a variable called total:
total = sum * rem

# test your division skills, divide total by 2:
total / 2
#store the quotient in a varialbe called quo:
quo = total / 2

# next up Modulus, modulo operation returns the remainder of a division
# test your modulo skills, 33 modulus 2:
33 % 2
# Store the remainder (modulus) in a var called mod:
mod = 33 % 2

# Exponents, Let's test them too, use 2 to the exponent of 4 : 
2 ** 4
# Now store the output in a var called expon:
expon = 2 ** 4

# Floor Division, sometimes you to not need or want the remainder, use floor division for 33 floor divided by 2:
33 // 2

#Store it in a var called floor:
floor = 33 // 2

#print all the vars!
# Example:
print("the remander is:", rem)

#Now let's take a look at print and formatting some output:

'''create two variables, one a int value and the other a string, test your print knowledge by leveraging % call formatting method
, then calling on the vars directly, then move to f-string method!'''
