# Welcome to BentTechD8 Python Fundamentals Support Repository!
## --I will be updating this as often as I can.....pinkie swear--

**YOUTUBE site**: ["BentTechD8"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLIHhPG_EizZ-de5BgIAVig).

## Tips for success:

* Python demands practice. The more you put in, the more you get out.
* You will become more proficient with python but you must put your bottom in a seat and fingers on keys
* Read more python code, not your own
* Relax, this stuff is made by humans, so you can do it too!
* Take it as slow or as fast as you want, I suggest you focus on understanding these Fundamentals
* Relax, python is a tool. You sharpen your mind then use the tool.
* Give yourself time to read the errors (tracebacks), they are there to help you!
* You will see RED, no biggie, this is where you want to make errors, learn from them, and move on
* This may sound odd at first, say your code out loud, it helps at first
